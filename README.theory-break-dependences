This branch aims to break dependences between TheoryEngine and theories---that
is, so if you modify theory_engine.h or any theory header, it doesn't recompile
all theories.  This doesn't require extensive changes, but should be
benchmarked, so this (short-lived) branch serves as a repository for this
work.
