These are examples of how to use CVC4 with each of its in-memory, library
interfaces.  They are essentially "hello world" examples, and do not
fully demonstrate the interfaces, but function as a starting point to
using simple expressions and solving functionality through each library.

These examples are built as a separate step.  After building CVC4, you
can make the examples by running "make" from inside the examples
directory.  With the default configuration, you'll find them in
builds/examples in the top-level source directory (if you configured
your own build directory, you'll find them there).
