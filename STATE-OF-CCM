the explain isn't currently accounting for the normalizing lookup in
propagate

maybe when we do normalizing lookup in propagate(), add an EQ to
pending.  failing example euf_simp06 - because we have

 ffx = x
 fffffx = x

 and ask if fx = x ?

problem is, lookup(f, ffffx) == [ fffffx = x ]

but that doesn't help.  fx is not congruent to x unless we do
normalizing lookup.  This normalizes ffffx to x.  Then we get
lookup(f, x) == [ fffffx = x ], but then in explaining why fx = x, all
we do is give the input eq [ fffffx = x ], when we need also
[ ffx = x ], which we used during normalization.

if we put (ffffx, x, [ffx = x]) in pending at the time of the
normalizing lookup we're probably safe, right?

alternatively, just have explain() explain why the lookup args are the
way they are.  i have a start to this but needs more args.
