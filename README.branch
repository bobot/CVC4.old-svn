This is a branch for experimenting with the pegtl parser generator.
It has only a partial grammar for SMT, and can only apply it to 
a memory-mapped file (not stdin).

Run cvc4 with --parse-only and --mmap or it will crash. 

It does not actually generate Exprs.
The point of this is just to see whether the raw parsing is fast enough
to continue implementing a full pegtl parser.
