CVC4 is open-source; distribution is under the terms of the modified BSD
license.  However, certain builds of CVC4 link against GPLed libraries,
and therefore the use of these builds is restricted in non-open-source
projects.  See below for a discussion of CLN and how to ensure you have
a build that doesn't link against GPLed libraries.

Certain builds of CVC4 link against a GPLed library, CLN, the Class Library
for Numbers, available here:

  http://www.ginac.de/CLN/

Please be advised that as this class library is covered under the GPL, the
combined work, CVC4+CLN, is also covered under the GPL and cannot be used
by proprietary software projects.  For the full text of the GPL, please
consult the CLN website.  CVC4 does not require CLN; it can be built against
libgmp, the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library, which is covered by
the more permissive LGPL.  To ensure that CLN is not used in the build,
configure CVC4 with "--without-cln".
