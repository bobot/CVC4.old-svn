To build, use the top-level script "autogen.sh" to invoke various
autotools.  You'll need reasonably new automake, autoconf, and libtool
installed.  Then ./configure && make as usual.

To build a source release, use "make dist"; this will include the
configure script and all the bits of automake/autoconf/libtool that
are necessary for an independent install.
