This is a prerelease version of CVC4; distribution is restricted.

For a suggestion of editing CVC4 code with emacs, see README.emacs.

To build, you'll need reasonably new automake, autoconf, and libtool
installed (see below). Execute,

    ./autogen.sh 
    ./configure
    make

To build a source release, use "make dist"; this will include the
configure script and all the bits of automake/autoconf/libtool that
are necessary for an independent install.
