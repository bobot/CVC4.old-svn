This is a prerelease version of CVC4; distribution is restricted.

For a suggestion of editing CVC4 code with emacs, see README.emacs.

To build, you'll need reasonably new automake, autoconf, and libtool
installed (see below). Execute,

    ./autogen.sh 
    ./configure
    make

You can then "make install" to install in the prefix you gave to
the configure script (/usr/local by default).

To build a source release, use "make dist"; this will include the
configure script and all the bits of automake/autoconf/libtool that
are necessary for an independent install.  You'll find the resulting
tarball in builds/cvc4-${VERSION}.tar.gz.

To build documentation, use "make doc".  Documentation is produced
under doc/ but is not installed by "make install".
