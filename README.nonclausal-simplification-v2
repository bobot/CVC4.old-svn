Branch to do:


* Preprocessing-time, non-clausal, Boolean simplification round to
  support "quasi-non-linear rewrites" as discussed at last meeting.
  Three modes, selectable on command-line via --simplification=MODE:

    batch - wait until QUERY/CHECKSAT before *any* preprocessing

    incremental (default) - do nonclausal preprocessing at each
    ASSERT, and clausify and do a round of propagation in SAT

    incremental-lazy-sat - do nonclausal preprocessing at each ASSERT
    but wait until QUERY/CHECKSAT before clausifying or involving the
    SAT solver at all

* RecursionBreaker<T> now uses a hash set for seen trail.
* Fixes to TLS stuff to support that.

==================
WHEN DOES TYPE CHECKING OCCUR NOW?  --is it soon enough? in nondebug builds
==================

==================
ALL THE BOOLEAN SIMPLIFICATION STUFF should happen in the Boolean
theory, and the whole simplification engine thingie should apply
theory stuff.
==================

==================
ADD new Cache class to entire ::simplify() infrastructure ? --but that
might miss new substitutions ?
==================
