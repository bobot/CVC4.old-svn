These are examples of how to use CVC4 with each of its in-memory, library
interfaces.  They are essentially "hello world" examples, and do not
fully demonstrate the interfaces, but function as a starting point to
using simple expressions and solving functionality through each library.

These examples are built as a separate step.  After building CVC4, you
can make the examples by running "make" from inside the examples
directory.  With the default configuration, you'll find them in
builds/examples in the top-level source directory (if you configured
your own build directory, you'll find them there).

Many of the examples (python, ocaml, ruby, etc.) do not need to be
compiled to run.  These are not compiled by "make"---see the comments
in the files for ideas on how to run them.
