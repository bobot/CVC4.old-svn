# library_versions
#
# Format is:
#   CVC4-RELEASE-VERSION-REGEXP (LIBRARY:VERSION)*
#
# This file contains library version release information.
# Lines are matched while processing configure.ac (and generating
# the configure script) using the CVC4_RELEASE_STRING.  Lines are
# matched on the regexp in the first column, with only the first
# matching line counting.  The library versions following, one per
# column, are then used.  If there are no matching lines, an error
# is raised and the configure script is not generated.
#
# When a new CVC4 release is cut, this library_versions file should
# be extended to provide library version information for that
# release.  PLEASE DON'T REMOVE LINES (or edit historical lines)
# from this file unless they are truly in error and the release
# wasn't made with that erroneous information; this file should
# ultimately provide a nice historical log of the mapping between
# CVC4 release numbers and the corresponding interface version
# information of libraries.
#
# For now, libcvc4bindings' version info is used for all language
# bindings libraries, and _also_ for all "compatibility" bindings
# libraries (i.e., the old CVC3-esque C and Java bindings).  This
# may need to be split out in future, if some bindings (particularly
# the compatibility ones) change more(/less) frequently than the
# others.
