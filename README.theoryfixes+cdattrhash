This branch will contain adjustments to the Theory interface and include
a "compressed" form of CDAttrHash<bool> for context-dependent Boolean flags
on nodes.  This stuff is being kept out of trunk until after a looming
bitvector deadline on 3/23/2011.

These changes are somewhat disparate but belong on the same branch because
they are held back from trunk all for the same reason (to keep the trunk
stable for furious bitvector development).

TODO BEFORE MERGE TO TRUNK:
****implement BitIterator find() in CDAttrHash<bool>.
****test to make sure less mem used than trunk
****test to make sure no performance regression

Specifically:

* Added QF_BV support for SMT-LIB v2.
* Two adjustments to the theory interface as requested by Tim King:
  1. Theories get the Valuation proxy object up front.  (This is the
     proxy back to TheoryEngine that theories use to get the value of
     subterms in getValue()---but it can be useful elsewhere, too,
     esp. for debugging.)  This changes the signature of the
     constructors for all theories, the signature of getValue(), and
     adds a data member to the Theory base class.
  2. Theories now have const access to the fact queue through base
     class functions facts_begin() and facts_end(); again, useful for
     debugging.
* Added an "Asserted" attribute so that theories can check if something
  has been asserted or not (and therefore not propagate it).  However, this
  has been disabled for now, pending more data on the overhead of it.
* Do not defined NDEBUG in MiniSat in assertion-enabled builds (so
  that MiniSat asserts are evaluated).
* As a result of the new MiniSat assertions, some --incremental
  regressions had to be disabled; also, some bitvectors ?!!
* Bug 71 is resolved by adding a specialization for CDAttrHash<> in the
  attribute package.
* Fixes for warnings flagged by clang.
* System tests have arrived!  So far mainly infrastructure for having
  system tests, but there is a system test aimed at improving code
  coverage of the printer package.
* Minor other adjustments to documentation, coding to be more
  conformant to CVC4 policy.

Tests have been performed to demonstrate that these changes have no or
negligible effect on performance.  In particular, changing the
CDAttrHash<> doesn't have any real effect on performance or memory right
now, since there is only one context-dependent boolean flag (as soon
as another is added, the effect is noticeable).
