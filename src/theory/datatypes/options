# How to handle selectors applied to incorrect constructors.  If this option is set,
# then we do not rewrite such a selector term to an arbitrary ground term.  
# For example, by default cvc4 considers cdr( nil ) = nil.  If this option is set, then
# cdr( nil ) has no set value.
#option dtSetErrorSel /--disable-dt-wrong-sel bool :default true
# disable rewriting incorrectly applied selectors to arb ground term
