 ** \brief This is a basic implementation of the Theory of Uninterpreted Functions
 ** with Equality.
 **
 ** This is a basic implementation of the Theory of Uninterpreted Functions
 ** with Equality.  It is based on the Nelson-Oppen algorithm given in
 ** "Fast Decision Procedures Based on Congruence Closure"
 **  (http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=322198&type=pdf)
 ** This has been extended to work in a context-dependent way.
 ** This interacts heavily with the data-structures given in ecdata.h .
