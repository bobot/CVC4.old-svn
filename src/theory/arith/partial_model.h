/* Side disucssion for why new tables are introduced instead of using the
 * attribute framework.
 * It comes down to that the obvious ways to use the current attribute
 * framework do not provide a terribly satisfying answer.
 * - Suppose the type of the attribute is CD and maps to type DeltaRational.
 *   Well it can't map to a DeltaRational, and it thus it will be a
 *   DeltaRational*
 *   However being context dependent means givening up cleanup functions.
 *   So this leaks memory.
 * - Suppose the type of the attribute is CD and the type mapped to
 *   was a Node wrapping a CONST_DELTA_RATIONAL.
 *   This was rejected for inefficiency, and uglyness.
 *   Inefficiency: Every lookup and comparison will require going through the
 *   massaging in between a node and the constant being wrapped. Every update
 *   requires going through the additional expense of creating at least 1 node.
 *   The Uglyness: If this was chosen it would also suggest using comparisons
 *   against DeltaRationals for the tracking the constraints for conflict
 *   analysis. This seems to invite misuse and introducing Nodes that should
 *   probably not escape arith.
 * - Suppose that the of the attribute was not CD and mapped to a
 *   CDO<DeltaRational*> or similarly a ContextObj that wraps a DeltaRational*.
 *   This is currently rejected just because this is difficult to get right,
 *   and maintain. However with enough effort this the best solution is
 *   probably of this form.
