 ** \brief A multiprecision rational constant.
 **
 ** A multiprecision rational constant.
 ** This stores the rational as a pair of multiprecision integers,
 ** one for the numerator and one for the denominator.
 ** The number is always stored so that the gcd of the numerator and denominator
 ** is 1.  (This is referred to as referred to as canonical form in GMP's
 ** literature.) A consquence is that that the numerator and denominator may be
 ** different than the values used to construct the Rational.
