This is a prerelease version of CVC4; distribution is restricted.

For a suggestion of editing CVC4 code with emacs, see README.emacs.

To build, you'll need reasonably new automake, autoconf, and libtool
installed (see below). Execute,

    ./autogen.sh 
    ./configure
    make

You can then "make install" to install in the prefix you gave to
the configure script (/usr/local by default).

To build a source release, use "make dist"; this will include the
configure script and all the bits of automake/autoconf/libtool that
are necessary for an independent install.  You'll find the resulting
tarball in builds/cvc4-${VERSION}.tar.gz.

To build documentation, use "make doc".  Documentation is produced
under doc/ but is not installed by "make install".

*** Dependencies

The following tools and libraries are required to run CVC4. Versions
given are minimum versions; more recent versions should be compatible.

GNU C and C++ (gcc and g++), reasonably recent versions
GNU Make
GMP v4.2 (GNU Multi-Precision arithmetic library)
libantlr3c v3.2 (ANTLR parser generator)
Optional: CLN v1.3 (Class Library for Numbers)
Optional: CUDD v2.4.2 (Colorado University Decision Diagram package)

CUDD, if desired, must be installed in a special manner.  The default
distribution from vlsi.colorado.edu doesn't build shared objects,
and names things that make it difficult to compose software
dependences (e.g. a "libutil" is distributed).  So we packaged our
own version of cudd that changes only its build process, making it
play nicely with libtool and packaging all the various cudd libraries
into just a few.  This version must be used for cvc4, and is available
from the CVC4 apt repository by dropping the following line into your
/etc/apt/sources.list:

  deb http://goedel.cims.nyu.edu/cvc4-builds/debian unstable/

The debian source package "cudd", available from the same repository,
includes a diff of all changes made to cudd makefiles.

*** Build dependencies

The following tools and libraries are required to build CVC4 from
scratch. 

Automake v1.11
Autoconf v2.61 
Libtool v2.2
ANTLR3 v3.2
