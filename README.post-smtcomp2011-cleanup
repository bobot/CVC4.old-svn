TODO on this post-competition cleanup branch:

preprocess dumping --dump=XX
** current issues with lemmas:
   symmetry breaker lemmas aren't valid
   ext lemmas aren't valid
   missed-t-propagations: "TRUE" is preregistered to THEORY_BOOL ??
** include level 0 BCP ?
** proper checking of properConflict() etc.
nodebuilder explicit instantiation & .cpp file ?  attributes ?  others?
CVC parser warnings
portfolio issues?
arrays and CC module
svn / git bridge ?

LOG OF CHANGES ON THIS BRANCH SO FAR
====================================
entire dumping infrastructure
CUDD building much cleaner
documentation, assertion fixes
copyright and file headers regenerated
printer improvements, printing of commands in language-defined way, etc.
typechecker stuff in expr package now autogenerated, no need to manually edit the expr package when adding new theory
